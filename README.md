# Kevin Pearse Art

Kevin Pearse Art is a site that hopes to showcase artist Kevin Pearse's work to engage and maximise his audience and customers. This site will be targeted towards fans of art and therefore will prioritise images of the artist's work in a well presented manner. The purpose of the site will be to showcase the art, to give information about the artist and upcoming events, and to allow the user to contact the artist. Kevin Pearse Art will be useful to potential customers of Kevin Pearse as they will be able to contact the seller and know where to find his upcoming events. It will also be useful to the artist Kevin Pearse in order to showcase his work. Due to the site showcasing art, the colour palette is particularly important. For this reason, the colours used on the website have been taken from a painting by the artist himself that will be the hero image. This feature will be beneficial to the artist and the user as it creates a cohesive website, showcasing Kevin Pearse's work through and through.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- __The hero image__

  - The hero image includes a photograph of a painting by artist Kevin Pearse. It does not include text overlay as the artist felt this would take the user away from admiring the artist's work, which is the goal of the image. The painting itself has the place name "Aberaeron" visible on a boat, giving context to the user of the places and scenes the artist features in his work.
  - The colour palette for the website has been used using this hero image, creating a cohesive experience for the user.

  - By including the About Me section on the home page, the artist is able to introduce himself in a more personal way and give context to his paintings before users and therefore potential customers and supporters delve into his art on the subsequent page of the Gallery.

- __The Contact Section__

  - This page will allow the user to contact the artist directly. The user will be instructed to write their name, email, and send a message of their choosing to the artist. This section is purposefully not too specific in its instructions as the messages from potential users could be in regards to ordering potentially through contacting the artist himself or in order to gain more information about the upcoming events.

### Features Left to Implement

- A feature I would like to implement would be a shop page, represented by a trolley icon in the navigation menu, in order to purchase any paintings directly from the website itself rather than contacting the seller.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
